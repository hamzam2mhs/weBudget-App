          <p class="lead">The Collaborative Budget System (aka weBudget) will be used to manage shared and personal household expenses.
            weBudget will manage and track the personal and shared expenses within a household. It is becoming more common to have multiple roommates to save
             money or more than one person spending money in a family household, but there is no elegant way of tracking these shared expenses between house members. 
             People continue using analog methods of managing these shared household expenses like posting receipts to boards and manually calculating totals and dividing 
             up between house members. With the application everyone will now be able to view digital copies of the bills, see each person's portion to pay of bills, and 
             pay that bill together as a household using the app. There will be no more worrying about lost bills, incorrect totals, or forgetting to collect money from 
             a house member for a bill. The application will also provide the ability to collect payment for one off outings or payments such as a dinner outing or recreational 
             sports team. Each individual would be able to pay their portion of the expense which would then be transferred to the designated payment person.
            The application will be used predominantly by people within households that have extensive shared expenses, and typically for those expenses that are complicated 
            to track and manage in traditional paper form. The owner of the household can create an account and manage shared expenses for all roommates that join the system. 
            The application will also be used by people who participate in group outings often. The application also serves individual people to manage their account in a more 
            convenient way, and individual users own personal ledger.
            In the pre-release versions of the application, sample households will be set up with generic data and payments owing to view the capabilities and potential issues. 
            Post-release versions will store information on a centralized machine that each user has the ability to access based on their group memberships.
            The application will be a significant improvement over a manual system. In a manual system, managing the expenditures and responsibilities across a household is a 
            difficult task. Keeping track of what has been spent in service to the residence and by whom is tricky, as is ensuring that all bills are paid on time, or that all 
            members are contributing fairly. With a digital system, all of this can be done automatically for the household, saving plenty of time for all house members This also 
            ensures that nothing is missed, as no receipts will be lost and no bills left accidentally unpaid. A digital system will make it much easier to hold people accountable 
            to their financial household obligations. It will be simple to send reminders to people on what they owe and each member can see what has been paid and what is still owing.
            weBudget will be considered successful if these criteria are met. In terms of features the app will be successful if bills can be organized and paid through our product 
            without error and keeping the privacy of the account owner. ser wise criteria for success is if users prefer this method of managing expenses over alternative applications 
            and over the traditional pen and paper approach by letting the app do all the calculation of the expenses which saves the time of the user. User success will be determined 
            through reviews and ratings of the app and the app will be improved over time by the suggestions given by the users of the app.</p>
