        <h1 class="display-4">Postmortem</h1>
        <p class="lead">During out iteration 2 retrospective the main point we decided that needed addressing was our distribution of tasks. During the iteration we attempted to have a task delegation system where people worked on specific layers but found the distribution was not even and we needed to spread ourselves out more.
        We took this and fixed the issue in iteration 3 by having everyone contribute to different layers and hop in to help if someone is falling behind which greatly helped ensure nobody got overwhelmed.</p>
        <h3 class="display-4" style="font-size: 20pt;color: #13B977;">If we could start over...</h3>
        <p class="lead">If we could start over we would have changed how we implemented the TransactionDatabase and associated logic. As is we incurred technical debt that we could not pay off which 
          hindered us from being able to display usernames in the transaction history details. We also would have been less ambitious about our estimates on how much we could accomplish during the term as we
          had to cut a number of features that were just not feasable under the time constraints.
        </p>
        <h3 class="display-4" style="font-size: 20pt;color: #13B977;">Features that work better than expected...</h3>
        <p class="lead">The main feature that worked better than expected was viewing the transaction history in the android calendar view. Given that it was going to require date parsing and iteration
          with an android calendar view which nobody had any experience with we estimated this task to be quite hard and coming into iteration 3 were prepared to cut if if necessary. After playing with the
          calendar and our transaction infrastructure we were able to easily create a consistent date structure for parsing and find excellent documentation on android calendar view to interact with it properly.
        </p>
        <h3 class="display-4" style="font-size: 20pt;color: #13B977;">What took the longest...</h3>
        <p class="lead">As expected the implementation of the application persistence took the longest. We had multiple bugs and the developers had many late nights attempting to set up the HSQLDB for the application.
          After we got the persistence running we determined a better way that it could have been done causing a complete refactor of the persistence layer further contributing to the time taken to implement the database.

        <h1 class="display-4">Velocity</h1>
        <img src="res/img/velocity.PNG" style="display:block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
        <p class="lead">In our above velocity chart you can see that we have been improving with every iteration and improving how we work as a team. During our first iteration we were still figuring out how to
          properly use design patterns and get an android application running, but managed to get our estimated and completed hours within 1 hour of eachother. During iteration 2 we took on alot more tasks than 
          in the first iteration and since we over estimated a little bit on iteration one we tried to be more conservative with estimations. This threw our velocity off quite a bit this iteration as we did not 
          know how much work would come with the HSQLDB implementation in our application. As a result our completed hours far outweighed the estimated hours in iteration 2, however we were happy with the amount more
          work we got completed in iteration 2 than iteration 1. During iteration 3 we managed to get even more work done, creating a nice upward trend in the amount of work we were able to get done through the iterations. 
          In this iteration we attempted to correct the under-estimation issue we encountered in iteration 2, causing us to make more generous estimations. This approach woorked to some degree as our estimate and completed 
          hours are much closer, but we unfortunately went too far the other way and were unable to get even estimated and completed hours. From the trend in the chart we are getting better and better at estimating and 
          working together as a team, given more iterations I believe we would get closer and closer to even estimated and completed hours.
